# kwin-macsimize
This is a fork of Aetf kwin-maximize-to-new-desktop. [Link to his work](https://github.com/Aetf/kwin-maxmize-to-new-desktop).

MACsimize is a KWin script that moves maximized windows to a new virtual desktop, moves back to original desktop if restored or closed. Each window takes place on a new virtual desktop, there's no need to add desktops manually.
